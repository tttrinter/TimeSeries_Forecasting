# TimeSeries_Forecasting
While working as a Data Science consultant, our company was engaged to review the sales forecasting methodology, bring efficiency to the current processes, and make the forecasts more data driven. This was for a Fortune 500 financial company. I led the project and worked with the client treasury and technology teams to:
1. Map the current process(es)
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Build a data pipeline to convert manual spreadsheet data into a relational database
4. Design the data warehouse to hold years of data, multiple forecasts, budgets, etc...
5. Create time-series forecast models at different levels of granularity
6. Create reporting tools for the treasury and sales teams to use in finalizing their budget and sales goals each quarter.

Since the client and the data are subject to strict non-disclosure rules, I've sanitized the data and the code to protect the innocent. The products have been translated into the sections and instruments of a symphony orchestra and the values modified to obfuscate the data. Much of the final, productional code remains with the client. However, here in this repository, I will resurrect or recreate as much as possible for general use (and my own memory).
